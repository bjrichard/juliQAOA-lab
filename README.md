# JuliQAOA Lab

This repository is an **exploratory research notebook** focused on understanding and experimenting with
QAOA-style workflows in Julia.

The material here is **not intended to be a polished or production-quality implementation**.
Instead, it reflects an ongoing learning and experimentation process, with emphasis on
understanding algorithms, parameter behavior, and implementation details.

## Relationship to JuliQAOA

A substantial portion of the material in this repository is **adapted from, inspired by, or directly based on**
the excellent **JuliQAOA** project.

This includes:
- code structure,
- function patterns,
- examples,
- and conceptual explanations.

This repository should be viewed as a **personal exploratory lab built on top of JuliQAOA**, not as an
independent or competing implementation. Full credit for the foundational ideas and original work
belongs to the JuliQAOA authors.

If you are looking for a robust, maintained QAOA implementation in Julia, you should refer directly to
the JuliQAOA repository.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intentionally exploratory in nature.

It may contain:
- lengthy comments,
- print statements,
- inconsistent notation,
- partially redundant code,
- and notebooks that prioritize intuition-building over presentation.

Some material is heavily quoted or closely follows existing references.
The ordering of topics may not be pedagogically optimal.

This is expected and intentional.

## Repository structure

```
notebooks/
├── exploratory/   # research notebooks with questions, TODOs, and intermediate reasoning
└── polished/      # cleaned, presentation-ready notebooks (results-focused)
```

Julia source files are provided alongside the notebooks to support experimentation.

## Intended audience

This repository is intended for readers who already have some familiarity with:
- QAOA and variational quantum algorithms,
- basic graph optimization problems,
- and Julia as a scientific programming language.

It is not designed as a standalone tutorial.
