# JuliQAOA Lab

This repository is an **exploratory research lab** focused on understanding and experimenting with
QAOA-style workflows in Julia.

The material here reflects an ongoing process of learning, experimentation, and intuition-building
around variational quantum algorithms, parameter behavior, and implementation details.
It is **not intended to be a polished or production-quality implementation**.

---

## Scope and contents

This repository includes:
- Jupyter notebooks documenting QAOA experiments, numerical studies, and intuition-building work.
- Julia source files supporting QAOA simulations, cost-function analysis, and related components.

The repository is best read as a **working research notebook** rather than as a finished tutorial or
software package.

## Relationship to JuliQAOA

A substantial portion of the material in this repository is **adapted from, inspired by, or directly based on**
the excellent **JuliQAOA** project developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory:

https://github.com/lanl/JuliQAOA.jl

This includes, among other things:
- overall code structure and organization,
- function patterns and implementation choices,
- example problems and workflows,
- and conceptual explanations.

This repository should be viewed as a **personal learning and experimentation environment built on top of
JuliQAOA**, not as an independent or competing implementation.  
Full credit for the foundational ideas and original work belongs to the JuliQAOA authors.

If you are looking for a robust, maintained QAOA implementation in Julia, you should refer directly to
the JuliQAOA repository linked above.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intentionally exploratory in nature.

It may contain:
- lengthy comments,
- print statements,
- inconsistent notation,
- partially redundant code,
- and notebooks that prioritize intuition-building over presentation.

Some material is closely derived from existing references, and the ordering of topics may not always
be pedagogically optimal.

This is expected and intentional.

## Intended audience

This repository is intended for readers who already have some familiarity with:
- QAOA and variational quantum algorithms,
- basic graph optimization problems,
- and Julia as a scientific programming language.

It is not designed as a standalone introduction to QAOA.
